//  Grades are Faculty-owned since 2026-10-02; the Registrar reads them.
//
//  These tests guard a BOUNDARY, not a behaviour. A read-only page that
//  quietly regains a save path is the failure this file exists to catch, and
//  nothing else in the suite would notice: the editor worked perfectly
//  before, so re-adding it would not break a single existing test.
//
//  Static source assertions are the right tool here. A browser probe
//  (tests/academic_readonly_probe.js) proves the rendered page is read-only
//  too, but it needs a live server; these run everywhere.
