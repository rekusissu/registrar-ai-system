<?php
// ============================================================
//  SHARED/MASTERLIST_FOLDERS.PHP
//  The folder shape of a masterlist: Program / Year / Section,
//  and the navigation that walks it one folder at a time.
//
//  Why folders at all
//  -----------------
//  A masterlist is not one list. It is a set of lists that
//  different offices need for different reasons, and until now
//  the only shape available was "filter the page and export",
//  which means every destination re-implements the same grouping
//  in a spreadsheet by hand.
//
//  A folder tree is the shape all three actually want: one folder
//  per program, one per year level inside it, one per section
//  inside that, and the roster inside the section folder. It is
//  also the shape a shared drive already has, so handing the same
//  tree to another system is the same operation as downloading it.
//
//  IT IS A BROWSER, NOT AN OUTLINE
//  -------------------------------
//  The page navigates ONE FOLDER AT A TIME, the way a shared
//  drive does: you are either at the root looking at program
//  folders, or inside BSIT looking at year folders, or inside
//  BSIT/Year 1 looking at section folders, or inside a section
//  looking at the masterlist that folder holds. Clicking a folder
//  goes INTO it.
//
//  The earlier version rendered every folder expanded on one long
//  page. That is the wrong shape for two reasons that are easy to
//  get wrong. It does not scale: a college with eight programs and
//  four years each produces hundreds of tables nobody will scroll
//  through. And it cannot answer the question the office actually
//  asks, which is "show me BSIT", not "show me everything, I will
//  find BSIT in the middle of it".
//
//  Four rules, and they are the whole design
//  ------------------------------------------
//  1. A folder is a GROUPING, never a copy. The folders are a
//     projection of `students`, not a second copy of it.
//     Creating a folder cannot invent students, and moving a
//     student between folders is the section assignment that
//     already exists on the Masterlist page.
//
//  2. The path is DERIVED from the student row, never stored.
//     A stored path is a second source of truth that disagrees
//     with `students.section` the first time somebody edits a
//     section, and a masterlist that files a student under a
//     folder they are not in is worse than no folder at all.
//
//  3. An unplaced student still appears, under an explicit
//     "Unassigned" folder, never silently dropped. The Masterlist
//     page hides unplaced rows because a signed section sheet
//     needs every row to be signable; a folder tree is an
//     inventory, not a signed sheet, and the registrar needs to
//     see the work that is left. Hiding them is how a cohort
//     goes missing.
//
//  4. The URL IS THE LOCATION. `?path=BSIT/Year 1/11001` is a
//     real address, so a folder can be bookmarked, linked into an
//     email to a department, and reached by Back. A tree that
//     only exists in a JS variable has none of those.
//
// Plus one rule added later, which the four above do not cover:
//
//  5. THE CATALOGUE IS THE SHAPE; THE DATA FILLS IT IN.
//     mlf_seed_catalogue() gives every OFFERED program a folder and
//     every program all four year levels, whatever the rows say.
//     Without it a folder only appears once it holds something, and
//     "where is BSCpE?" and "does BSCpE have no Year 3?" print the
//     same empty screen - and the second question is the one a
//     registrar actually asks while chasing a missing cohort.
//     Seeding adds FOLDERS, never rows, so rule 1 still holds.
//
//  Pure functions. The database stays in the page and the API,
//  so this file is unit tested without one — the grouping rules
//  are the part worth pinning.
