<?php
// ============================================================
//  SHARED/DOCUMENT_PROCESS.PHP
//  The walk-in document process, in one place.
//
//  Two questions, kept deliberately separate because they are
//  genuinely different facts about a request:
//
//    1. Where is the work?     → document_status
//       Filed → Processing → Ready → Claimed, plus Rejected.
//
//    2. What is it waiting on? → blocked_reason / blocked_since
//       NULL means nothing is blocking it.
//
//  Collapsing (2) into (1) is what made multi-day requests
//  invisible. A request parked on the Dean's clearance looked exactly
//  like one the clerk had simply not started, so nothing on the desk
//  could tell "waiting on someone else" from "waiting on us" — and
//  the request aged quietly either way.
//
//  Two real causes of a long wait, both derived from data rather than
//  typed in by hand:
//
//    · Exit clearance  the catalog SKU needs Alumni + Dean + Property
//                      to sign off first
//    · Balance owing   the student has an unpaid finance balance
//
//  A named requirement used to be the third. It is not a blockage and no
//  longer counts as one — see doc_blocker() and doc_requirement_note().
//
//  Include this rather than re-deriving the logic: intake
//  (api/student-documents.php), the desk (registrar/documents.php)
//  and the API (api/documents.php) must agree, or the desk will
//  promise something intake never checked.
// ============================================================

//  receipt for — so the friction is the feature.
//
//  Why it is a gate rather than a hard block
//  ------------------------------------------
//  Hard-blocking strands the students who genuinely paid and lost the
//  screenshot. That queue gets cleared informally anyway: a registrar
//  processes the request and moves on. The result is the worst of both —
//  the receipt is nominally mandatory but in practice isn't, and nobody
//  knows which is which. So staff can waive it, but only with a typed
//  reason, and the waiver lands in document_request_events beside every
//  other status change. The record then reads truthfully: was the
//  receipt seen, or was it waived, and by whom.
//
//  The two signals are independent and both are kept: the gateway
//  callback says money moved; the receipt's GCash reference number is
//  what finance reconciles on. When they disagree, that is exactly the
//  request a registrar should be looking at.
