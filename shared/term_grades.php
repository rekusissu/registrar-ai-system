// ============================================================
//  SHARED/TERM_GRADES.PHP
//  One place that computes a GWA, and one place that audits a term.
//
//  Two problems this file exists to remove.
//
//  1. There were two GWA numbers. academic_history.gwa was typed by hand;
//     document_templates.php computed its own weighted average from
//     final_rating x units and never read the stored one. A student typed
//     at 2.50 and computing to 2.91 looked fine to the status rules and
//     different on the TOR. termGwa() is the only implementation, and the
//     save path stores its result, so the two can no longer disagree - the
//     status rules read the same number the TOR prints.
//
//  2. Nobody could see a term was incomplete before closing it. The
//     commonest failure in term grading is a missing rating, and it is
//     silent: a student with no grade looks exactly like a student with a
//     good one. termAudit() reports what is missing while it is still
//     editable.
//
//  Read-only. It computes and it reports; it never writes.
// ============================================================

//  Faculty grade source contract
//
//  Where the grades actually come from is STILL UNDECIDED — an API sync, a
//  file import, or a nightly dump. Nothing above this line should care.
//
//  So the read path is defined as an interface and satisfied locally. The
//  pages and the printable template call these three functions and cannot
//  tell whether the rows behind them arrived from a REST call or are sitting
//  in our own tables. When the decision is made, a second implementation is
//  added behind the same contract; no page changes.

//  when a remote system is down is worse than one printed from the last
//  known figures, provided the last sync is stated on the document.
