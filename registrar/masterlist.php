//
// A query parameter rather than a JS flag, so the view is a real
// address: the Back button works and either view can be linked to.

// reads the list in - open a program, open a year, open a section,
// read the roster - and it needs no filter set to be useful, where
// the flat list opens as one long sheet of every cohort on file.
// The printable blocks are still one click away and are still what

// Anything unrecognised falls back to the default rather than
// rendering nothing, because a stale bookmark must not dead-end.

/* The name is the anchor, and it is set in caps. Three reasons, in order:

   1. A roster is a register, not a contact list. Filipino school and office
      records set names in caps for exactly this reason - it is the convention
      of the document, and a name that breaks it reads as informally typed.
   2. It gives the one column a texture nothing else has, so a clerk can find
      their place in a fifty-row list by shape alone. Every other column is
      short tokens of similar weight; this is the only block of unbroken type.
   3. Caps let the SURNAME carry the weight instead of the size. Both halves
      stay at 15px - the earlier version set the given names at 11.5px grey
      under a caps surname, and that read as a headline over a caption, which
      is not what a name is.

   The caps are applied in CSS, not baked into the stored value. Uppercasing in
   PHP would write AQUINO into the DOM text, and then a search for "Aquino" - the
   name as it is actually written in the database and on every form the student
   signs - would find nobody, because the box matches the rendered text. CSS
   text-transform is presentation: the markup still carries "Aquino".

        <!-- THE VIEWS OF THE SAME RECORDS.
             There are three: the flat list is what gets printed and
             signed, the Folders table shows every folder on one
             expandable page, and the Folders browser walks into one
             folder at a time the way a shared drive does — click BSIT
             and you are inside BSIT.

             There is NO view toggle in the header any more. All three
             buttons are gone: Browse, Table, List. What replaced a
             choice is a default — the browser is simply what this page
             IS, and ?view=folders and ?view=list still render in full
             for anyone holding the URL.

             So the header no longer states which view you are in. That
             is a real loss and it is deliberate: the one button that
             was left said nothing the page did not already say, and
             three buttons advertised two ways into a module that has
             one. The view a reader is in is now visible from the page

                         reach the last columns. `clip-path` rounds the corners
                         without touching overflow, so the axis keeps working. -->

// answer.

/* The roster inside a section folder.
   This is its own table (.mlx-table), NOT the printable List's
   ledger (.masterlist-table). That is deliberate. The ledger is
   table-layout:fixed with hand-measured per-column tracks and a
   1390px floor, sized for the List's own eleven columns; a
   fourteen-column roster that borrowed the class set none of those
   tracks, so every column fell to an equal share and the floor
   forced a sideways scroll for no reason.

   It also avoids inheriting the List's search, sort and CSV-export
   handlers, which key off .masterlist-table and would otherwise
   read this roster through the List's column map and write the
   wrong headers over it.

   These tracks are chosen by what each column CONTAINS rather than
   by a fixed layout: the browser sizes them, so a table that fits
   the window uses the space instead of scrolling, and the ones
   that must not wrap (codes, dates, numbers) are pinned. */
