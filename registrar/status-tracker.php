      Two decisions the content makes here. Each row leads with the status
      glyph in a tinted square rather than a 7px dot, because the dot was
      too small to carry the status colour into a scan and the glyph is
      the same vocabulary the table badges and the case panel already use.
      And the count is stated as a number and a share, since the fill bar
      implies a proportion that nothing otherwise quantified.

      Statuses with nobody in them are collapsed to a footnote. On a
      hundred-student roster that is usually half the list, and eight rows

      Composition, then the breakdown.

      The card leads with one large figure and a single stacked bar, which
      is what actually answers "what is this roster made of" in a glance
      at a 268px column. A list of rows cannot: it has to be read. The bar
      was previously the thing this rework deleted, and the right answer
      was not to drop the idea but to move it above the list where it
      carries the composition and the list carries the numbers.

      The per-row proportion fills that replaced it are gone. A bar per row
      and a bar for the whole say the same thing twice; the stacked bar is
      the honest one, and the rows are left free to be a clean key with a

      <?php /* The filter. Four facets - year, program, semester, section - as
             tick lists in one panel.

             They were not always here. Year was a strip of four buttons above
             the search and program was its own single-select beside it, which
             is two controls for one question: "3rd year" only means anything
             relative to a program, and picking 3rd year on its own returns half
             of every program on the roster. One panel says the relationship
             instead of making it be inferred from two unrelated widgets.

             A <details> element, so the disclosure, the open state and the
             keyboard behaviour are the browser's rather than reimplemented.
             Plain checkboxes in a GET form: the panel posts on Apply, no JS
             required, and the four parameters are shareable as a URL.

             Every facet is optional and they combine with AND. Ticking values
             INSIDE one facet widens the result - 1st OR 2nd year - which is
             why these are boxes and not radios. */

/* --- Recording a status change ---
   The only write path on this page, and it is a form a person fills in.

   Two rules the old Apply button broke. It posted the new status the
   moment it was clicked, with no confirmation — one mis-click changed a
   student's record. And it sent no reason, so trackStatusChange() logged
   a null and the journal could show that someone changed and nothing
   about why. Both are fixed here: the reason is required client-side and
   rejected server-side, and the window fields are only offered for
//   statuses that are actually time-boxed. */

// The effective/return date fields. This used to list loa, probation and
// transferred - the three statuses that were time-boxed by nature, and all
// three of which are gone. None of the five current statuses is a window:
// enrolled, active, graduate, alumni and dropped are all indefinite states.
//
// The fields are therefore never offered, and toggleWindowFields() is kept as a
// no-op rather than deleted, because the markup that calls it on change is
// harmless and removing the call sites would be a larger change to a form
// layout than the status list itself warrants. If a windowed status is ever
// reintroduced, this is the list to add it to - and it must be a status in
// studentStatuses(), or the date would be written for a state that cannot exist.
