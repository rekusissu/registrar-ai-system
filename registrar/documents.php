/* -- Row actions ------------------------------------------------
   A row has exactly ONE forward step and it is the thing the clerk
   came to do, so it is rendered at full strength, always. Nothing
   here is dimmed to signal "secondary" ? that made the primary
   action on every row look disabled, and it only came back on
   :focus-visible, so a mouse user never saw it clearly at all.

   Hierarchy is carried by weight and fill instead:
     primary   filled blue, full opacity   ? the next step
     danger    outline, muted red          ? available, not inviting
   De-emphasis, where it is wanted, is applied to the SECONDARY
   control only (.btn-danger), never to the action itself. */
/* Three controls in this cell, and letting them wrap pushed View onto a
   second line where it read as a footnote to the row rather than a
   control. The column is sized explicitly instead: the forward step
   gets the width it needs, Reject takes what is left, and View spans
   the pair underneath ? where a three-button row would have been too
   cramped to read. */
/* -- The process rail --------------------------------------------
   Where the request is standing in the walk-in run, drawn as a
   lollipop: a dot on each stage, a line running to the next.

   Three earlier revisions were wrong and it is worth recording how,
   because each time I treated this as something to STYLE rather than
   something to REDUCE. Square stamp pads (a costume, not a
   reference); circles on a rule (which is what this is again ? but
   then carrying four words per row); a typographic strip; and a
   tally. The tally was closest to right and still wrong, because a
   count says how many and not which. A lollipop says both: the dot
   is the station, the line is the journey between them.

   Only the CURRENT stage is named. The other three are the same on
   every row, and the "Waiting on" column already carries the state
   in words, so repeating them twenty times cost a line of height to
   say nothing row-specific.

   COLOUR comes from the palette the app already ships in
   registrar.css (.pill.active / .pending / .at-risk / .inactive)
   rather than a private one. An earlier revision invented navy,
   brass and rust, which read as a different product sitting inside
   this one - the same reason those values are wrong is the reason
   they look wrong:
     passed   green  #16a34a   the app's "done" green
     in hand  amber  #b45309   .pill.pending
     held     red    #dc2626   .pill.at-risk
     ahead    grey   #cbd5e1   .pill.inactive, the 200 step
   Amber is reserved for the station actually being worked, so it is
   the only warm mark on the row and the eye lands on it first.

   MOTION: the line inks itself left to right on load, then the dot
   for the current station rises and takes a slow pulse. It runs
   once, never on every row hover - motion here answers "where did
   this start", and repeating it would be noise. Fully disabled
   under prefers-reduced-motion, and the dots are still in their
   final positions, so the rail is legible without the animation. */
