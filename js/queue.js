    //
    // It used to be:
    //     return fetch(url, opts).then(function (r) { return r.json(); });
    //
    // which collapses three very different failures into the same rejection,
    // and the pages then showed "Network error." to a student standing at a
    // kiosk:
    //
    //   · the API is at the wrong URL  -> 404, body is HTML, .json() throws
    //   · the API is unreachable       -> fetch rejects
    //   · the API threw                -> 500, body is HTML or JSON
    //
    // The 404 case is the one that bit production: the client had guessed the
    // API path wrong, asked for /queue/api/queue-public.php, and the reported
    // symptom was an unhelpful one-liner while the real fault - a URL that does
    // not exist - was invisible without a network tab and the server logs.
    //
    // So the status and the URL now travel with the error. Anything that shows
    // the message to a user, or prints it to the console, names the request
    // that failed, which is reportable by someone with no server access.
    // Report a failed queue request once, with enough detail to act on.
    //
    // Five of the call sites used to end in `.catch(function () {})`, which is
    // the reason this class of fault was so hard to pin down: the monitor
    // simply stayed blank, and the console showed nothing. A silent catch is
    // only acceptable when nothing could be done about the failure; here the
    // URL and status are usually the whole answer.
