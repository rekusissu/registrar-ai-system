#  Responsibilities (runs as root, then hands off to Apache as root so the
#  master can bind :80; workers drop to www-data automatically):
#    1. Create the writable runtime dirs (uploads/, logs/) and re-seed their
#       `.htaccess` "deny script execution" guards whenever they were hidden
#       behind a fresh, empty Docker volume.
#    2. Make those dirs writable by the www-data Apache worker.
#    3. Optional: run `composer install` on first boot (used by the DEV
#       bind-mount override where the host's gitignored vendor/ is absent).
#    4. exec Apache so it stays PID 1 and receives signals/stop cleanly.
